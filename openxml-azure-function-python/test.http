    "INTRODUCTION": "CCR8 expression is upregulated on a highly immunosuppressive subset of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in multiple cancer types. TAK-188 is an Antibody Drug Conjugate (ADC) targeting CCR8. TAK-188 is designed specifically for depleting Tregs and boosting the immune system to produce an antitumoral effect.",
    "STUDY OBJECTIVE": "The objective of this study is to examine the plasma stability of TAK-188 in vitro in fresh mouse, monkey, and human plasma.",
    "REGULATORY GUIDELINES": "",
    "Good Laboratory Practice Compliance": "This study will not be conducted in accordance with the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Part 58: Good Laboratory Practice for Nonclinical Laboratory Studies, issued by the United States Food and Drug Administration. However, this study will be conducted according to standard departmental practices.",
    "Amendments To, and Deviations From, the Protocol": "Any changes to the protocol will be described in a written protocol amendment approved by the Study Director specified in this protocol and recorded in the raw data at Takeda Development Center Americas, Inc.
