Check the following text for compliance with the abbreviation usage rules described below and make corrections when necessary. DO NOT change the meaning of the phrases. The rules are:

1. The abbreviations 'US' (United States), 'UK' (United Kingdom), and 'EU' (European Union) can be used as both modifiers and nouns. 'EU' should only be used as an abbreviation for the European Union, not for the geographic region Europe.

2. When a city name is followed by the name of a state, territory, possession, province, or country, the latter should be spelled out in full at first mention. When city, state, county, territory, possession, province, and country names stand alone, they should also be spelled out in full.

3. Use 2-letter abbreviations for US state and Canadian province names in full addresses (with US zip codes and Canadian postal codes) and in reference lists (e.g., location of book publishers). However, do not use these abbreviations in the main text.

Your task is to review the following text and make corrections where necessary:
