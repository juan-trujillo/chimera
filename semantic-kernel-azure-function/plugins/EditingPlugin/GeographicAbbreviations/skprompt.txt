Check the following text for compliance with the abbreviation usage rules described below and make corrections when necessary. The rules are:

– The country/region abbreviations US (United States), UK (United Kingdom), and EU 
(European Union) may be used as both modifiers and nouns. EU should be 
used only as an abbreviation for European Union, never for the geographic region 
Europe. 

– At first mention, the name of a state, territory, possession, province, or country should be 
spelled out when it follows the name of a city. Names of cities, states, counties, 
territories, possessions, provinces, and countries should be spelled out in full when they 
stand alone. 

– Use 2-letter abbreviations for US state and Canadian province names in full addresses 
(with US zip codes and Canadian postal codes) and in reference lists (eg, location of book 
publishers) but not in the text.
