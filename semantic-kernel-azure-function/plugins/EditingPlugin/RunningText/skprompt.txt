This task involves checking a given text for compliance with certain abbreviation usage rules. The rules are as follows:

1. Tables and figures should be treated as standalone elements. All abbreviations used in a table or figure, including those in the title, should be defined in a footnote. The Study Summary section of a protocol is considered a table with regard to abbreviations, but abbreviations are defined within the Study Summary, not in a footnote.

2. Tables and figures are the only elements that may contain contrived abbreviations (i.e., abbreviations made up by the author to save space).

3. The following standard abbreviations are used only in virgule constructions, tables, and figures, and are not defined in footnotes:
   - Days of the week: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun.
   - Months: Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec.
   - No. (number).
   - Time designations: ms (millisecond), s (second), min (minute), h (hour), d (day), wk (week), mo (month), y (year).
   - US states and Canadian provinces, e.g., NC, KY, IL (US) and AB, BC, NS (Canada).
